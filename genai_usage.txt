Tool / Model:
- ChatGPT (GPT-5.2 Thinking)

What I used GenAI for:
I used ChatGPT to help me generate starter HTML/CSS (including Bootstrap components) for my multi-page personal website and to help troubleshoot GitHub Pages setup for extra credit.

1) Home page (HTML + Bootstrap)
Prompt (summary):
"Help me create a Lab 3 personal website with a Bootstrap navbar + right-side icon, an image of myself, a short description, a resume link, and a footer with a social link."

Response (what I used):
- A Bootstrap-based home.html template with the navbar, icon button, layout for image + text, and footer.

What I changed after:
- I replaced placeholder content with my own image (me.jpg) and adjusted the relative paths to match my repo structure.

2) Hobbies page (HTML + Bootstrap)
Prompt (summary):
"Write hobbies.html using Bootstrap with three hobbies (making movies, reading, writing) and images from my repo."

Response (what I used):
- A hobbies.html template using Bootstrap cards and image tags with correct relative paths.

What I changed after:
- I added my actual images (hobby1.jpg, hobby2.jpg, hobby3.jpg) and checked that they render correctly.

3) Projects + Resume pages (HTML)
Prompt (summary):
"Make projects.html and resume.html consistent with the Bootstrap navbar/footer and format resume sections."

Response (what I used):
- Templates for projects.html and resume.html with consistent layout.

What I changed after:
- I edited the resume content to reflect my research focus.

4) Extra credit: GitHub Pages
Prompt (summary):
"Help me publish the website using GitHub Pages and fix a 404."

Response (what I used):
- Steps to push via SSH, enable Pages from the main branch, and add a root index.html redirect.

What I changed after:
- I added personal_website_link.txt with my GitHub Pages URL.
